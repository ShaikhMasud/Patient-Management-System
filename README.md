# ðŸ©º Patient Management System (Microservices)

A fully Dockerized microservices system built with Spring Boot, gRPC/protobuf, Kafka, and PostgreSQLâ€”featuring modular architecture, REST and RPC endpoints, synchronous and asynchronous inter-service communication, and scalable event-driven design.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Youâ€™ve built a production-style microservice ecosystem with three core services:

- **Patient Service** â€“ handles patient data  
- **Billing Service** â€“ performs billing logic  
- **Analytics Service** â€“ consumes patient events for analysis  

Everything is packaged with Docker and orchestrated using Docker Compose. Communication happens both via gRPC (Patient â†” Billing) and Kafka (Patient â†’ Analytics), following industry best practices.

## ðŸ›  Infrastructure & Docker Setup

Docker Compose orchestrates:

- PostgreSQL container for persistence  
- Kafka brokers  
- Each microservice runs in its own Docker container built via respective Dockerfile  
- Services share a custom Docker network for seamless internal communication  
- Configurations (ports, topic names, DB credentials) are managed via environment variables and `pom.xml`

Each service uses **Maven** to manage dependencies, build lifecycle, and compile protobuf definitions where needed.

## Service-by-Service Breakdown

### âœ… Patient Service

- Exposes REST endpoints such as `POST /patients`, `GET /patients/{id}`  
- Publishes events to a Kafka topic (e.g., `patient-events`) on creation/update  
- Sends billing requests via gRPC to the Billing Service  
- Features layered structure: `Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ DTOs`  
- Shares the `patient.proto` for generating Java stubs used in Billing Service  
- Uses Maven to handle dependencies for Spring Boot, Kafka, gRPC, and protobuf  
- Protobuf compilation and gRPC client stubs are configured via the Maven protobuf plugin in `pom.xml`

### âœ… Billing Service

- Hosts gRPC RPC endpoints to process billing requests (defined in `billing_service.proto`)  
- Invoked synchronously by Patient Service for billing generation  
- Encapsulates billing logic with DTOs, services, and persistence via its own database  
- Uses Maven for Spring Boot and gRPC dependencies  
- gRPC server stubs are generated through Maven during the build process using the protobuf plugin  

### âœ… Analytics Service

- Subscribed to Kafka topics via configured Kafka Consumer  
- Consumes messages from the Patient Service producer (Patient)  
- Stateless listener service designed to facilitate analytics dashboards or logs later  
- Handles serialization/deserialization and error logging in the consumer layer  
- Maven manages dependencies for Spring Boot, Kafka clients, and JSON processing  

## ðŸ”„ Communication Mechanisms

### gRPC (Protocol Buffers)

- Defined in `*.proto` file  
- Compiled using Maven plugin (`protobuf-maven-plugin`) to generate Java classes  
- Billing Service implements the `ServiceGrpc` interface  
- Patient Service uses gRPC client to invoke billing actions  
- All gRPC dependencies and plugin configurations are managed in each serviceâ€™s `pom.xml`

### Kafka (Event Streaming)

- Patient Service acts as producer, sends serialized patient events  
- Kafka topic (like `patient-topic`) configured in `application.yml` or through environment variables  
- Analytics Service registers `@KafkaListener` to process incoming events  
- Supports scalability via consumer group configuration (e.g., `groupId`)  
- Kafka client dependencies are handled via Maven

## ðŸŒŸ Key Learning Outcomes

- End-to-end Dockerization of microservices + infrastructure  
- Modular code structure using DTOs and layered architecture for maintainability  
- Synchronous communication via gRPC (protobuf-defined)  
- Asynchronous, decoupled messaging via Kafka producer/consumer  
- Experience configuring and orchestrating PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Docker Compose  
- Effective use of Maven for dependency management, protobuf generation, and service builds
